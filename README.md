# Bulo

ios 14.0+ | Swift 5.5.1 | Xcode 13.1

## Summary

Bulo helps you track your progress through projects you're working on.

Kick things off by adding a project and giving it items. For example, maybe the project you want to complete is "Become an iOS Engineer". The first item might be "Buy a MacBook", then "Sign up for a Swift course", and so on.

Give projects a title and description, plus a custom colour to make it personal, and edit all of these whenever you need to. Add new items to a project at any time and watch the project progress bar tick along as you make your way through each task and mark it as completed.

Items can have titles and detailed descriptions, plus a high, medium, or low priority. When you've completed all the items in a project, mark it as complete by closing it. If life gets in the way, put a project on pause by closing it too and then reopen it later on. If you decide the project is no longer something you want to pursue, get rid of it entirely by deleting it and its items altogether.

To help you stay on top of things, Bulo suggests the high priority items you should work on next in the Home tab. As you progress you'll earn awards by adding and completing more and more items, viewable in the Awards tab. View all of your open or closed projects and their items at any time in the Open and Closed tabs respectively, sorting their items by date added, alphabetically, or using Bulo's optimal sorting - whichever suits you best.
